# üíÑ Styled-RN

Styled Components for React Native the way they should have been.

Inspired by [this article](https://dev.to/lenilsondc/writing-a-styled-hoc-for-react-native-using-typescript-3i25)

---

## Intro

Why üíÑ `styled-rn` it better than üíÖüèº `styled-components/native` ?

Well, first of all, using styled components should be fun, but using css to style a React Native app is cumbersome and often ends up to be very messy.

Also:

- `styled-rn` gives you access to ALL React Native style props
- `styled-rn` is faster because it does not do tedious string template processing
- `styled-rn` is easier to use (again, no messy string templates)
- `styled-rn` is fully typed and has a nice API
- `styled-rn` supports custom props, theme via `ThemeProvider`, multiple style objects and more..
- `styled-rn` has a shorter name ;)

## Usage:

```
npm i styled-rn
```

```ts
import { styled } from "styled-rn";

// Basic usage
export const Container = styled.View({
  flexDirection: "row",
  backgroundColor: "cyan",
});

// Use with any component
export const CoolAndBoldComponent = styled(CoolComponent, {
  fontWeight: "bold",
});

// Pass props to the styled component (attrs)
export const NonWrappingText = styled.Text(
  {
    color: "blue",
  },
  {
    attrs: {
      numberOfLines: 1,
      ellipsizeMode: "tail",
    },
  }
);
```

## Theming:

You will need to do a few things in order to propagate the `theme` prop into all of your styled components:

1. Define your theme object and the type for it
2. Augment the `Theme` type
3. Wrap your app in `ThemeProvider`

First, define your theme:

```ts
// mytheme.ts

export const theme = {
    primary: "blue",
    background: "white",
    ...
} as const;

export type MyAppTheme = typeof theme;
```

TODO: add example on how to use multiple themes

Now you need to augment the default `Theme` type with your own type. In order to do that, create a definitions file at the root of your source tree (e.g. `global.d.ts`) and add the following to it:

```ts
import { MyAppTheme } from "./mytheme.ts";

declare module "styled-rn" {
  // eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-empty-interface
  interface Theme extends MyAppTheme {}
}
```

And finally, the wrapping, as usual:

```tsx
// App.tsx

import { ThemeProvider } from "styled-rn";
import { theme } from "./mytheme.ts";

export default function App() {
  return <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>{/* your app components */}</ThemeProvider>;
}
```

And that's it! You can now access your theme in any styled component:

```ts
export const Button = styled.TouchableOpacity(({ theme }) => ({
  backgroundColor: theme.background,
}));
```

If you want to use custom props in your styled component, make sure that your custom props interface extends `ThemedProps`. E.g.

```ts
// Important:         üëá
interface ButtonProps extends ThemedProps {
  disabled?: boolean;
}

export const Button = styled.TouchableOpacity(({ disabled, theme }: ButtonProps) => ({
  opacity: disabled ? 0.3 : 1,
  backgroundColor: theme.background,
}));

// Using conditional styles with custom props
interface SmartComponentProps extends ThemedProps {
  active?: boolean;
}
export const SmartComponent = styled.TouchableOpacity(({ active, theme }: SmartComponentProps) => [
  {
    fontSize: 16,
  },
  active && {
    fontWeight: theme.activeFontWeight,
    color: theme.activeColor,
  },
]);
```

You can also use `theme` in your components by calling the `useTheme()` hook or by wrapping your component with `withTheme()` HOC.

```ts
import { useTheme } from "styled-rn";

export const MyComponent = () => {
  const theme = useTheme();
};
```

## Known Issues

- When component returns the style from inline function sometimes the style object has to be type casted to ViewStyle, TextStyle, etc... Otherwise, you'll get a weird TS error. It looks like a TS bug. If you don't want to cast your styles, make sure that you pass props to the function and USE THE PROPS in your styles.
